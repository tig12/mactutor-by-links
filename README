Builds a list of mathematicians from MacTutor index.
This list is sorted by link count (link count of a mathematician
is the number of links pointing from other mathematicians' pages
to the page of that mathematician).

Executed once 2019-10-21 and 22
to build an eminence indicator for an other program :
https://github.com/tig12/gauquelin5

Code released under the General Public Licence (GPL)
Written in PHP 7.2; tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.4

Departure URL to build the list :
https://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Indexes/Full_Chron.html

Result of program execution can be downloaded from :
https://g5.tig12.net/auxiliary/eminence/math/mactutor/


Installation
------------
Install PECL extension php-yaml :
sudo apt install php-yaml


Preparation
------------
- Copy config.yml.dist to config.yml
- Adapt the paths to your local machine


Execution
------------
In a console, from current directory (containing this README) :

Retrieve pages containing the biographies on your local machine :
php run/1-get-bios.php

Retrieve pages containing the places on your local machine :
php run/2-get-places.php

Generate csv :
php run/3-bylinks-csv.php


Execution result :
------------

step 1
permits to retrieve 2842 persons

step 2
permits to retrieve birthplaces except for 166 mathematicians
(1269 birthplaces)

step 3
see build/stats.php


Examine result
------------
php build/stats.php


Result
------------
https://g5.tig12.net/auxiliary/maths/mactutor/mactutor-by-links.csv.zip
To open the resulting csv file, use ";" as separator. Do not use "," because some fields contain comas.

ID      : MacTutor id
NAME    : full name, as written in MacTutor site
N_LINKS : number of links pointing to a mathematician's page (link count).
B_DATE  : birth date, YYYY-MM-DD
B_PLACE : birth place, as written in MacTutor site
B_LG    : longitude of birth place, in decimal degrees
B_LAT   : latitude of birth place, in decimal degrees
B_WIKIPEDIA : Wikipedia url corresponding to birth place
D_DATE  : death date, YYYY-MM-DD
D_PLACE : death place


TODO
------------
- Possibility to retrieve wikipedia url from birth place => compute geonames id + country without ambiguity

- Handle "now" in MacTutor place names : possible to compute original place name and present place name
